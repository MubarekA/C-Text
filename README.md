This repository is the Backend for a feature on the <a href='https://github.com/MubarekA/Flashcardapp2'> Flashcard application </a>. It utilizes the Google vision API 
for Optical Character Recognition(OCR). As a result, this allows students to take pictures of multiple-choice tests and have them in a flashcard format.
